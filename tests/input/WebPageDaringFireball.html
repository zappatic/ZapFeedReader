</dt>
<dd>
<p>Mark Gurman:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Netflix Inc. isn’t planning to launch an app for Apple Inc.’s 
upcoming Vision Pro headset, marking a high-profile snub of the 
new technology by the world’s biggest video subscription service. </p>

<p>Rather than designing a Vision Pro app — or even just supporting 
its existing iPad app on the platform — Netflix is essentially 
taking a pass. The company, which competes with Apple in 
streaming, said in a statement that users interested in watching 
its content on the device can do so from the web. [...]</p>

<p>The fact that Netflix isn’t even willing to support the iPad 
approach suggests that it’s taking a wait-and-see stance with the 
headset. It’s also a bit of a reversal for the company, which 
<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-23/apple-vision-pro-will-developers-sell-visionos-apps-for-the-3-499-device-lkfg5b1l?sref=9hGJlFio">said in July</a> that it would support its iPad app on the Vision 
Pro. Even then, though, Netflix didn’t plan to release software 
specifically for the headset’s operating system, visionOS. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Said in July” links to a report from Gurman himself, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-07-23/apple-vision-pro-will-developers-sell-visionos-apps-for-the-3-499-device-lkfg5b1l?sref=9hGJlFio">which states</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But the biggest streamer of all, Netflix Inc., will take a pass. 
I’m told that the company has no current plans to develop a native 
app for the Vision Pro. Of course, Netflix will still let its iPad 
app run on the headset unmodified. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>“Of course”!</p>

<p>Here’s the statement from Netflix:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Our members will be able to enjoy Netflix on the web browser on 
the Vision Pro, similar to how our members can enjoy Netflix on 
Macs,” Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said in the statement. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Mac users sure do <em>enjoy</em> <a href="https://help.netflix.com/en/node/54816">not being able to download Netflix movies or shows</a> for offline viewing — you know, like in an airplane, one of the most obvious and common places where Vision Pro will be used.</p>

<p>Not having a native VisionOS app is one thing. Apparently having no current plans to make one is another. But it really feels like pure corporate spite — a pissing match — that Netflix is refusing the allow their iPad app to run on VisionOS. The iPad-app-on-Vision experience is actually pretty good, and for streaming apps in particular, ought to be fine. Not impressive, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/16/disney-plus-visionos">like the native VisionOS Disney+ app</a>, but just fine. I’ll bet that Netflix is the <em>only</em> major streaming service without an app on VisionOS — iPad or native — on day one. Perhaps Netflix is using this as a negotiating tactic for something in return from Apple?</p>

<p>In addition to the fact that only being available through the web means no offline viewing, it might also mean that VisionOS users will not be able to launch Netflix from their home screens. I’m not sure if VisionOS Safari has an “Add to Home Screen” feature, but if it doesn’t, that’s going to be an annoyance for Vision Pro users who want to watch Netflix. Telling Siri to open “netflix dot com” might be the only way to get there from your home screen.</p>

strongly disagree with the USITC decision and resulting orders. </p>

<p>Pending the appeal, Apple is taking steps to comply with the

<p>Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 without the Blood 
Oxygen feature will become available from apple.com starting 6am

<p>Without the <em>feature</em> — not without the <em>sensor</em>, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/16/apple-workaround-itc-import-ban">as Aaron Tilley of The Wall Street Journal reported</a> in a story that <em>still</em> has not been corrected.</p>

<p>Apple, a court filing spotted by <a href="https://twitter.com/Florian4Gamers/status/1738673544572162438">Florian Mueller</a> at Games Fray:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Please take notice that on March 5, 2024 at 10:00 a.m., or as soon 
thereafter as the matter may be heard by the Court, at the 
courtroom of the Honorable Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers, [...] Apple 
Inc. (“Apple”) will and hereby does move that this Court, pursuant 
to the mandate of the Ninth Circuit, enter judgment ordering Epic 
Games, Inc. (“Epic”) to pay Apple $73,404,326, plus additional 
amounts Apple is incurring during this ongoing litigation, under 
the indemnification provision of the Developer Program License 
Agreement. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is not simply about Epic having sued Apple and lost; it’s about the fact that this whole saga started with Epic’s Fortnite in-app payment processing stunt, blatantly violating <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/terms/apple-developer-program-license-agreement/#ADPLA10">the Developer Program License Agreement</a>. This wasn’t like an edge case or technicality; Epic deliberately violated the clear rules of the DPLA as a publicity stunt to launch their antitrust lawsuit. File under “Fucking Around and Finding Out”.</p>

<p>Mueller writes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Early into the litigation, Epic accepted that if it loses on its 
antitrust claims (as it did), it owes damages. If Epic had 
prevailed on antitrust, the contract clause wouldn’t have been 
enforceable. [...] </p>

<p>Apple does this as a matter of principle. They won’t leave an 
amount in the tens of millions on the table. And their overall 
treatment of Epic, such as not putting Fortnite back, is meant to 
discourage other app makers from challenging Apple and from 
breaching the DPLA. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s unsurprising but worth noting that <em>Fortnite</em> is seemingly never coming back to iOS, unless Epic sells the franchise to another company. iOS <em>Fortnite</em> players are like the children in an ugly divorce.</p>

<h6 class="dateline">Wednesday, 17 January 2024</h6>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1747280541362102287/">Tim Sweeney, on Twitter/X, yesterday at 10:30am</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As of today, developers can begin exercising their 
court-established right to tell US customers about better prices 
on the web. These awful Apple-mandated confusion screens are over 
and done forever. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That take didn’t last long.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1747408148799881390">Sweeney, yesterday at 7:00pm</a>, after Apple released <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/16/apple-guidelines-external-purchase-links">the details of its intended compliance</a> with the anti-steering (<em>anti-anti-steering</em>?) mandate from the Epic v. Apple case:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A quick summary of glaring problems we’ve found so far: </p>

<ol>
<li>Apple has introduced an anticompetitive new 27% tax on web 
purchases. Apple has never done this before, and it kills price 
competition. Developers can’t offer digital items more cheaply 
on the web after paying a third-party payment processor 3-6% 
and paying this new 27% Apple Tax.</li>
</ol>

<p>[Sweeney’s points 2–4, complaining about Apple’s stringent design, 
presentation, and privacy demands regarding external links, 
omitted.] </p>

<p>Epic will contest Apple’s bad-faith compliance plan in 
District Court. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sweeney’s description makes it sound as though Apple is demanding its commission from all web sales for apps and services that have an iOS app. They’re not. They’re only demanding the commission from web sales that occur within 7 days of a user tapping through to the web from <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/storekit-external-entitlement-us/">the new External Purchase Links entitlement</a> in an app. Any app or service that already sells over the web, without paying a cent to Apple, can continue to do so in exactly the same way.</p>

<p>Also, Apple <em>has</em> done this before: what they announced yesterday is almost exactly in line <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2022/02/going_dutch">with their compliance with Netherlands regulations pertaining to dating apps in 2022</a>.</p>

<p>Before yesterday:</p>

<ul>
<li>iOS app developers could sell digital content and subscriptions over the web, without paying Apple any commission.</li>
<li>iOS apps outside <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2021/09/01/apple-anti-steering-relaxation">the “reader” category</a> could not link to, nor even tell users about, those web purchases from within their apps.</li>
</ul>

<p>After yesterday:</p>

<ul>
<li>Apps that wish to link to — or, I think, even inform users about — web purchasing options from within their iOS apps must (a) still offer Apple’s IAP for those items; (b) pay Apple its adjusted 27/12 percent commissions on web sales that come from inside iOS apps; (c) send Apple sales data monthly and submit to audits of their sales; and (d) follow Apple’s stringent design edicts for these in-app links to the web.</li>
<li>Apps that do not link out to their web stores from within their iOS apps using Apple’s new External Purchase Links entitlement can continue whatever they were doing before yesterday. For apps that do nothing new, Apple is collecting nothing new.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m only surprised that Sweeney was seemingly surprised by any of this. He genuinely seemed to think that Apple not only would, but <em>had to</em> allow links from within apps to the web for purchases without collecting any commission on those sales, and that developers could present those links however they chose.</p>

<p>I’m glad that Sweeney and Epic plan to contest this, because I’m genuinely curious whether Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers sees Apple’s solution as complying with her injunction against their prior anti-steering rules. But I think it <em>does</em> comply.</p>

<hr />

<p>To be clear, I think Apple should allow apps <em>other than games</em> to just tell users they can pay/buy/subscribe/whatever on the web, without any commission. That the rules which have applied only to “reader” apps since early 2022 should be extended to all apps other than games, perhaps alongside a requirement (which doesn’t apply to “reader” apps) that apps taking advantage of this <em>also</em> offer in-app purchasing.</p>

<p>I’d draw an exception for games — an exception that surely Sweeney would disagree with completely, given that he’s in the games business — because games are different, and hefty un-circumventable revenue commissions to platform owners are clearly standard for the video game industry. The iPhone and iPad are not PCs; they’re consoles for games and apps.</p>

<p>But I’m not sure at all that Apple is doing anything contrary to the law. Sweeney (and other critics of Apple’s stewardship of iOS as a tightly controlled console) believe Apple both shouldn’t and <em>legally can’t</em> comply with the anti-steering injunction this way. I only believe Apple shouldn’t, not that they legally can’t.</p>

<p>Most critics of Apple’s control over all iOS software are seemingly of the view that iPhones and iPads should, on principle, be largely like the Mac, where the App Store is an option, not the only game in town for software distribution. Personally, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/annotating_apples_anti-sideloading_white_paper">I am on the record wishing that Apple would allow some sort of “expert” or “developer” mode</a> — chock full of warnings, perhaps even requiring a developer account to enable — that would basically offer the same options for installing third-party software on iOS as there are on the Mac. That’s me, personally, an expert user. But even setting aside every penny of revenue generated by the App Store,<sup id="fnr1-2024-01-17"><a href="#fn1-2024-01-17">1</a></sup> I see and understand many of the reasons why Apple wouldn’t want to do this. There are a lot of Mac users whose Macs are overrun by adware and other scammy software. I’m not talking about viruses or malware, even — but apps that just abuse the largely free-for-all nature of the Mac platform.</p>

<p>Basically, there’s an argument that iOS devices should be more like traditional PCs (including the Mac), on ethical or moral grounds. The “<em>it’s my device, I should decide and control what software runs on it</em>” argument. I get it. But I also get that most consumers’ Windows PCs, and many Macs,<sup id="fnr2-2024-01-17"><a href="#fn2-2024-01-17">2</a></sup> are riddled with bad software (privacy invasive, resource hogging, and all sorts of <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2021/12/22/grammarly-disables-spell-checking-globally/">anti-user shenanigans</a> you’d never think of) that App Store policies forbid. App Store review is far from perfect — I mean come on, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/search/app+store+rejection">that should go without saying</a> — but it is undeniable that adversarial software is not a problem for <em>any</em> typical users on iOS. Nothing you install from the App Store can damage your iPhone or iPad experience. Nothing you install from the App Store is difficult to uninstall if you don’t like it. The same is true of dedicated game consoles like Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox — and to a lesser degree (because Google’s Play Store review seems comparatively lax) for Android.</p>

<p>But the cynical take is that it’s all about the money for Apple. Maybe the cynics are right! Let’s just concede that they are, and that Apple will only make decisions here that benefit its bottom line. My argument remains that Apple <em>should not</em> be pursuing this plan for complying with the anti-steering injunction by collecting commissions from web sales that initiate in-app. Whatever revenue Apple would lose to non-commissioned web sales (for non-games) is not worth the hit they are taking to the company’s brand and reputation — this move reeks of greed and avarice — nor the increased ire and scrutiny of regulators and legislators on the “anti-Big-Tech” hunt.</p>

<p>Apple should have been looking for ways to <em>lessen</em> regulatory and legislative pressure over the past few years, and in today’s climate that’s more true than ever. But instead, their stance has seemingly been “<em>Bring it on.</em>” Confrontational, not conciliatory, conceding not an inch. Rather than take a sure win with <em>most</em> of what they could want, Apple is seemingly hell-bent on trying to keep <em>everything</em>. To win in chess all you need is to capture your opponent’s king. Apple seemingly wants to capture every last piece on the board — even while playing in a tournament where the referees (regulators) are known to look askance at blatant poor sportsmanship (greed).</p>

<p>Apple’s calculus should be to balance its natural desire to book large amounts of revenue from the App Store with policies that to some degree <em>placate</em>, rather than antagonize, regulators and legislators. No matter what the sport, no matter what the letter of the rulebook says, it’s never a good idea to piss off the refs.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Coming to Grips With Apple’s Seemingly Unshakable Sense of Entitlement to Its Commissions From Third-Party iOS Apps’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/coming_to_grips_with_apples_seemingly_unshakable_sense_of_app_store_entitlement">&#9733;</a></p>

<p>iOS App Store policy critics often point to the Mac as all the evidence they need that Apple could open up software distribution on iOS with no ill effects to users. I wrote about this back in 2021, in a piece titled “<a href="https://daringfireball.net/2021/06/annotating_apples_anti-sideloading_white_paper">Annotating Apple’s Anti-Sideloading White Paper</a>”. Quoting from that column, which begins with a quote from <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Building_a_Trusted_Ecosystem_for_Millions_of_Apps.pdf">Apple’s white paper</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Page 9:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>iPhone is used every day by over a billion people — for banking, 
to manage health data, and to take pictures of their families. 
This large user base would make an appealing and lucrative target 
for cybercriminals and scammers, and allowing sideloading would 
spur a flood of new investment into attacks on iPhone, well 
beyond the scale of attacks on other platforms like Mac.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here Apple dances around the elephant in the room — the question 
of why iOS shouldn’t just work like the Mac with regard to non-App 
Store software. Apple’s deft argument is that there are far fewer 
Macs than iOS devices, making the Mac a less enticing target for 
scammers and crooks (including privacy crooks). That’s more or 
less the argument Windows proponents used to explain the profound 
prevalence of malware on Windows compared to the Mac back in the 
day, whilst Apple (and Mac proponents) argued otherwise, that the 
Mac actually was far more secure at a technical level.</p>

<p>But the truth Apple won’t come out and say is that it’s <em>both</em>. 
The Mac <em>was</em> more secure by design, but <em>also</em> a far less 
enticing target because of how many more users were (and still 
are) on Windows. And, today, iOS <em>is</em> more secure and private than 
the Mac. That’s the nature of the Mac as a full PC platform.</p>

<p>I’ll admit it: if Mac-style sideloading were added to iOS, I’d 
enable it, for the same reason I enable installing apps from 
outside the App Store on my Mac: I trust myself to only install 
trustworthy software. But it doesn’t make me a hypocrite to say 
that I think it would be worse for the platform as a whole.</p>

<p>The Mac is fundamentally designed for users who are at least 
<em>somewhat</em> technically savvy, but tries its best to keep non-savvy 
users from doing things they shouldn’t. But you can always hurt 
yourself, sometimes badly, with any true power tool. The iPhone is 
the converse: designed first and foremost for the non-savvy user, 
and tries to accommodate power users as best it can within the 
limits of that primary directive.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><p>All the more pertinent today, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/vestager_cook">as Apple faces down the March 7 deadline for compliance with the E.U.’s Digital Markets Act</a> that ostensibly mandates sideloading on iOS.&nbsp;<a href="#fnr2-2024-01-17"  class="footnoteBackLink"  title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a>

<p>Scharon Harding, reporting for Ars Technica:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple has developed a backup plan for if the Apple Watch Series 9 
and Ultra 2 are import banned again. As it currently appeals the 
US International Trade Commission’s (ITC’s) ruling that its 
watches violate a patent owned by Masimo, Apple has come up with a 
software workaround that strips its current smartwatches of their 
controversial blood oxygen monitoring capabilities. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>That’s a good summary of Apple’s workaround from a writer who understands what she’s talking about. Apple will disable blood-oxygen monitoring via software.</p>

<p>Compare and contrast with Aaron Tilley’s report for The Wall Street Journal, under the jacktastically-wrong headline “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/apple-watch-ban-united-states-update-cd069ab4">Apple to Remove Blood-Oxygen Sensor From Watch to Avoid U.S. Ban</a>” (<a href="https://apple.news/A0oSSFm6wTy2vmPERu7MhRQ">News+ link</a>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is removing a blood-oxygen sensor from some of its 
smartwatches to get around a patent dispute related to the 
technology, a step likely to avoid further sales disruptions but 
one that may raise questions about the company’s push into 
health. [...] </p>

<p>The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency, which is 
responsible for enforcing import bans, on Friday approved 
technical changes to the watches, including the removal of the 
blood-oxygen sensor, according to a Masimo filing on Monday. A 
decision on Apple’s request for a permanent stay on the U.S. ban 
during its appeal is expected in the coming days. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ars includes <a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Masimo-letter-January-15.pdf">a link to Masimo’s filing</a>; the WSJ does not. Needless to say, Masimo’s filing does <em>not</em> say that Apple is removing the blood-oxygen sensor from these watches, because they’re not. They’re just disabling the sensors via software for watches sold in the U.S. — the only country where the import ban applies.</p>

<p>This is no little mistake on Tilley’s and the Journal’s part. Disabling a feature via software is one thing, and not that big a deal. Designing, engineering, and manufacturing entirely different hardware models without the physical sensors would be extraordinary. That’s just not how Apple works — they’re not set up to change manufacturing like that. Plus, if Apple merely disables the sensor via software, they can re-enable it via a software update in the future, once the dispute is settled. If they were to start selling Series 9 and Ultra 2 watches that didn’t have the sensor, those watches would <em>never</em> gain the functionality, even after the dispute is settled.</p>

<p>Aaron Tilley isn’t just a tech reporter for the Journal: his entire beat is covering Apple. And he seemingly has no idea how the company functions, because if he did, he’d have quadruple checked this “they’re removing the sensors” take before publishing it. But here it is a day after publication and his report has yet to be corrected. Pure jackassery.</p>

<p>Apple Developer News:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In addition to using Apple’s convenient, safe, and secure in-app 
purchase system, apps on the App Store in the United States that 
offer in-app purchases can also use the StoreKit External 
Purchase Link Entitlement (US) to include a link to the 
developer’s website that informs users of other ways to purchase 
digital goods or services. To use the entitlement, you’ll need to 
submit a request, enable the entitlement in Xcode, and use 
required StoreKit APIs. Apple will review your app to ensure it 
complies with the terms and conditions of the entitlement, as 
well as the App Store Review Guidelines and the Apple Developer 
Program License Agreement. [...] </p>

<p>Your app must offer in-app purchases in accordance with the 
Developer Program License Agreement and App Store Review 
Guidelines, and may not discourage end-users from making in-app 
purchases. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple clearly had these updated guidelines ready to go, pending this week’s decision from the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/16/scotus-epic-apple">rejecting the remaining petitions from Apple and Epic</a>.</p>

<p>Scroll down the page, then scroll some more, and you’ll get to the section on “Commission, transaction reports, and payments”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple is charging a commission on digital purchases initiated 
within seven days from link out, as described below. This will not 
capture all transactions that Apple has facilitated through the 
App Store, but is a reasonable means to account for the 
substantial value Apple provides developers, including in 
facilitating linked transactions. </p>

<p>Apple’s commission will be 27% on proceeds you earn from sales 
(“transactions“) to the user for digital goods or services on your 
website after a link out (i.e., they tap “Continue” on the system 
disclosure sheet), provided that the sale was initiated within 
seven days and the digital goods or services can be used in an 
app. This includes (a) any applicable taxes and (b) any 
adjustments for refunds, reversals and chargebacks. For 
auto-renewing subscriptions, (i) a sale initiated, including with 
a free trial or offer, within seven days after a link out is a 
transaction; and (ii) each subsequent auto-renewal after the 
subscription is initiated is also a transaction.] </p>

<p>If you’re a participant in the Small Business Program, or if the 
transaction is an auto-renewal in the second year or later of an 
auto-renewing subscription, the commission will be 12%. </p>

<p>These commission rates apply to all amounts paid by each user net 
of transaction taxes charged by you. You will be responsible for 
the collection and remittance of any applicable taxes for sales 
processed by a third-party payment provider. </p>

<p>If you adopt this entitlement, you will be required to provide 
transaction reports within 15 calendar days following the end of 
each calendar month. Even if there were no transactions, you’re 
required to provide a report stating that is the case. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again now, and I’m sure I’ll have to say it again in the future: Apple’s 30/15 percent commissions from App Store purchases and subscriptions are <em>not</em> payment processing fees. They <em>include</em> payment processing fees, but most of those commissions are, in Apple’s view, their way of monetizing their intellectual property. And they see the entire iOS platform as their IP.</p>

<p>So developers who want to process payments on their own websites are still on the hook to pay Apple the same effective commissions, minus only 3 percent for the actual payment processing. And the truth is most of the time credit card processing costs more than 3 percent overall, after chargebacks and fraud are taken into consideration. Do more work and save no money — sounds appealing, no?</p>

<p>Available only on Apple Vision Pro, Disney+ subscribers will be

<p>I got to try this during <a href="https://mastodon.social/@gruber/111767493035111862">another hands-on Vision Pro demo</a> <a href="https://www.threads.net/@gruber/post/C2LKPu5P0Wu">in New York today</a>. (Follow those links to Mastodon and Threads, where I’ve tried to answer every question asked by my followers.)</p>

<p>It’s 100 percent a gimmick, but it’s a really good fun whimsical gimmick, and the detail is extraordinary. It looks like you are there on Tony Stark’s helipad penthouse deck, with a towering view of Manhattan in front of you, and Stark’s apartment behind you. These are 360° environments. The Tatooine view in the landspeeder is right outside Mos Eisley, at dusk.</p>

<p>Does it make the movie you’re watching any better to see it while sitting in an immersive fantasy environment? No, of course not. But it’s a lot of fun, because it’s so intricately detailed and well-done. Did the Mac OS X Aqua user interface make Mac users more productive? Did the original iPhone work better because its interface looked so damn cool? No. But those UIs sure did make Mac OS X and the original iPhone more fun.</p>

<p>I don’t know why people lose sight of the fact that having fun is one of the very best parts of being a human. The Disney+ app for VisionOS is fun.</p>

<p>Epic CEO Tim Sweeney:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Supreme Court denied both sides’ appeals of the Epic v. Apple 
antitrust case. The court battle to open iOS to competing stores 
and payments is lost in the United States. A sad outcome for all 
developers. </p>

<p>Now the District Court’s injunction against Apple’s anti-steering 
rule is in effect, and developers can include in their apps 
“buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct 
customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to IAP”. </p>

<p>As of today, developers can begin exercising their 
court-established right to tell US customers about better prices 
on the web. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s sad for Epic, perhaps, and game developers in general, but I think overall this is a good day for developers, and a great day for users. In-app game purchases are already too predatory, as things stand — they’d get far worse if games on iOS were free to circumvent Apple’s system. If a developer wants users to sign up and pay on their website, they can now tell them so, in plain language, in the app.</p>

<p>The truth should never be against the rules. If you need to pay/subscribe on the app’s website, the app should be able to tell you that you need to pay/subscribe on their website.</p>

<p>Adi Robertson, reporting for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Supreme Court has denied a request to hear an antitrust 
dispute between Apple and <em>Fortnite</em> publisher Epic Games. It 
<a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/011624zor_e1pf.pdf">rejected two petitions</a>, one from each company, this 
morning — leaving the case largely, but not entirely, a win for 
Apple. [...] </p>

<p>Even so, both rulings found that Apple had acted 
anticompetitively by barring developers from telling users about 
other payment methods. Apple was ordered to let them allow links 
and other “calls to action” that would bypass Apple’s payment 
system, discontinuing what are known as anti-steering policies. 
But the company spent years delaying parts of the change with 
legal appeals, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/9/23826043/epic-apple-app-store-supreme-court-petition">winning a reprieve while</a> the Supreme Court 
considered the case. Today’s denial seemingly runs out that 
clock, requiring Apple to reconsider the future of its 
anti-steering rules. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Apple’s intransigence on these anti-steering provisions has <a href="https://daringfireball.net/2019/01/netflix_itunes_billing">long baffled me</a>. I’ve consistently argued that the rules should be simple: apps that want to accept in-app payments must use Apple’s IAP system, but apps should be free to inform users that they can sign up and pay on the web, outside the app. In-app: Apple’s platform, Apple’s payments system. Out-app: the open web, and apps should be able to steer customers there. If Apple’s in-app purchasing system is so easy to use, so reasonably priced for its benefits, and so trusted by users, it should be able to compete openly with the web. And I think Apple’s in-app payments <em>do</em> compare favorably to leaving an app to pay on the web, especially for games. But with true competition from web purchases that apps can steer users to, Apple’s commission rates, for apps other than games at least, would probably be lower. I’d argue that it’s unhealthy for a company to grow dependent on unnaturally high commissions protected by fiat policies, rather than set through open competition.</p>

<p>Perhaps Apple’s thinking was that they might as well try to hold the line on these anti-steering provisions for as long as they could, thinking that today’s outcome was the worst case scenario. But I think it’s been a bad look for the company for years, and invited additional regulatory scrutiny. Regardless of whether these anti-steering provisions are <em>legally</em> anticompetitive, they’re undeniably anticompetitive in the plain sense of the word. I genuinely believe the Supreme Court has done Apple a favor letting this ruling stand.</p>

  <p>For a case built for this express purpose, the keys are crucial to 
get right, and Clicks has nailed it, I think. The keys are rounded 
and have a bit of space in between each one, but the layout 
overall feels familiar and well done. The keyboard layout is also 
specifically designed to be really similar to the default iOS 
keyboard, which makes it feel all the more familiar. </p>

<p>Each key is also backlit and has an excellent tactile response. 
That’s the aspect I was most concerned about, and while some of 
the pre-production models were a little rough, the final version 
that I was able to test during my hands-on (not pictured) felt 
<em>perfect</em>. It was clicky and tactile without being loud or too 
hard to press. [...] </p>

<p>In my brief time using it, I’m very much of the opinion that 
Clicks is pretty much as good as this concept can be. It’s 
well-designed, comfortable to use, and hits all of the right 
notes. </p>

<h6 class="dateline">Saturday, 13 January 2024</h6>

<p>European Commission chief Margrethe Vestager is on the West Coast meeting with U.S. tech executives. Here’s her entire statement on meeting Tim Cook at Apple Park, <a href="https://twitter.com/vestager/status/1745693612262953300">posted on Twitter/X</a> (I’m surprised she posts on a U.S.-based platform, rather than one of the popular E.U. social networks):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2 main points from my meeting w/ @tim_cook @apple ⬇️ </p>

<p>👉 compliance w/ #DMA, e.g. @Apple’s obligation to allow the 
distribution of #apps outside the @AppStore </p>

<p>👉 ongoing @EU_Competition cases e.g. @AppleMusic </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are so many meetings and negotiations where I’d pay a veritable fortune to have been a fly on the wall. Vestager meeting with Cook this week was <em>not</em> one. My guess is that absolutely nothing interesting was said. Nothing but platitudes.</p>

<p>The deadline for compliance with the DMA is March 7, and the big issue for Apple is the App Store: allowing native apps to be installed from outside the store (a.k.a. sideloading), and allowing alternative in-app payment methods. My understanding is that Apple has everything prepared for compliance, but, exactly what that’s going to look like, seemingly no one outside the company knows.</p>

<p>We know nothing about how Apple plans to allow sideloading. I expect that even for users in the E.U., sideloading will be off by default. I also expect that, unlike the Mac, sideloaded apps will still need to be signed by Apple. Will apps distributed through the App Store allow third-party in-app payment processing, or will that only be available to sideloaded apps? I further presume, that just like when Apple complied with Dutch regulations specific to dating apps, third-party apps that implement their own payment processing for in-app purchases will be required to provide Apple with detailed accounting and pay Apple a 27% commission.</p>

<p>Will sideloading <em>only</em> be available within the E.U., or will Apple implement the same policies worldwide? For the most part Apple tries to keep things the same worldwide, but sideloading is such an exception that I expect them to region-lock it to the E.U. Especially given that stipulation that Apple needs to permit sideloaded apps to act as app stores themselves. How is <em>that</em> going to work?</p>

<p>I expect that Apple has designed sideloading in such a way that very few users will enable it. (This seems to be largely the case on Android, which has permitted off-by-default sideloading from its inception.) I also expect that Apple will still demand 27% of in-app purchase revenue from apps that choose to implement their own payment processing.</p>

<p>Basically, I don’t think much will change for E.U. users, or for developers. But a lot of people — including Vestager and the European Commission — expect a <em>lot</em> to change. It’s just not clear at all exactly what Apple needs to allow to comply with the DMA, nor do any of us outside Cupertino have any idea what Apple plans to do. Complying with the <em>letter</em> of the DMA does not mean capitulating to the <em>spirit</em> of the DMA. The idea that Apple is going to roll over and give up on steering their own platform the way they feel best benefits both their own bottom line, and <a href="https://www.apple.com/privacy/docs/Building_a_Trusted_Ecosystem_for_Millions_of_Apps_A_Threat_Analysis_of_Sideloading.pdf">their users’ experience/privacy/security</a>, is naive.</p>

<p>The European Commission expected that the GDPR would result in websites prioritizing the privacy of E.U. users — a better web in Europe than elsewhere. Instead, the result was increased user annoyance under a nonstop daily barrage of consent popovers — a <em>worse</em> web in Europe than elsewhere. I suspect the same will prove true of the DMA and mobile platforms. Fireworks are coming, but it seems like few people know it.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Margrethe Vestager Met With Tim Cook Yesterday, But I Doubt Anything Happened’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/vestager_cook">&#9733;</a></p>

  <p>The Federal Aviation Administration said on Friday that after

the plan to proceed. In a statement, FAA also said it would keep 
the Boeing 737 Max 9 “grounded until extensive inspection and

of the planes remain grounded in the United States as airlines 
Alaska and United await updated emergency inspection guidance from

<p>Dominic Gates, reporting for The Seattle Times last week:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When the Boeing 737 MAX 9’s side blew out explosively on Alaska 
Airlines Flight 1282 Friday evening, a 15-year-old high school 
student was in the window seat in the row directly ahead, his 
shoulder beside the edge of the gaping hole. </p>

<p>His mother, who was seated beside him, in the middle seat of row 
25, described the moment as a very loud bang, like “a bomb 
exploding.” </p>

<p>As the air in the passenger cabin rushed out, the Oregon woman 
turned and saw her son’s seat twisting backward toward the hole, 
his seat headrest ripped off and sucked into the void, her son’s 
arms jerked upward. </p>

<p>“He and his seat were pulled back and towards the exterior of the 
plane in the direction of the hole,” she said. “I reached over and 
grabbed his body and pulled him towards me over the armrest.” </p>

<p>The boy had been wearing a T-shirt and a V-neck pullover 
windbreaker. Both were ripped off his body. “I could see his 
back,” Faye said. “My mind just assumed his shirt had been pulled 
up by me grabbing him. I did not know that it had been torn off. 
It didn’t even occur to me.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>A harrowing story. If his shirt and pullover were pulled off his body, and his seatbelt headrest sucked through the void, it sure sounds like <em>he</em> was nearly sucked out of the plane. Terrific reporting by Gates, too — the mother’s name is not publicly known, and she was initially resistant to tell her story to the press. She changed her mind only after Alaska Airlines put forth a version of events that made the incident seem far more tame than it clearly was. Good infographics, too.</p>

<p>Unmentioned in the story is whether the passengers near the door plug were wearing their seatbelts. I suspect they all were, perhaps luckily, because the plane had only just taken off and was still ascending to cruise altitude. In years past I’d often leave my seatbelt unbuckled mid-flight, other than when the pilot turned on the mandatory seatbelt light, but a few bouts of out-of-nowhere turbulence over the years changed my mind on that. Never in a million years would I have considered a scenario like this one.</p>

<p>Kevin Systrom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We’ve made the decision to wind down operations of the Artifact 
app. We launched a year ago and since then we’ve been working 
tirelessly to build a great product. We have built something that 
a core group of users love, but we have concluded that the market 
opportunity isn’t big enough to warrant continued investment in 
this way. It’s easy for startups to ignore this reality, but often 
making the tough call earlier is better for everyone involved. The 
biggest opportunity cost is time working on newer, bigger and 
better things that have the ability to reach many millions of 
people. I am personally excited to continue building new things, 
though only time will tell what that might be. We live in an 
exciting time where artificial intelligence is changing just about 
everything we touch, and the opportunities for new ideas seem 
limitless. </p>

<p>I am particularly proud of all the work our small team of 8 has 
accomplished. For instance, our app was recently named the 
everyday essential app of the year by the Google Play Store. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Winning an award on Android is a little like winning the Canadian Football League title. Artifact had great potential — no surprise given its pedigree: Systrom and Mike Krieger are hall of famers for Instagram — but never became a top-tier iOS app.</p>

<p>When it debuted a year ago, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/01/31/artifact">I called it a disappointment</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s just <em>ads ads ads</em>, interrupting seemingly every single 
article, every couple of paragraphs. This same “<em>man, I miss ad 
blockers</em>” feeling strikes me when I use Apple News too, but Apple 
News articles have way fewer ads, and better ads, than what I’m 
seeing so far in articles I read in Artifact. “Like Apple News but 
worse” is not a good elevator pitch. [...] </p>

<p>Instagram was an instant sensation because it was obviously such a 
premium experience. Great photos, with cool filters (which filters 
were necessary to make phone camera pictures look great a decade 
ago), a simple social concept, all wrapped in a great app. 
Artifact does feel like a nice app, but the reading experience, at 
least today, is anything but premium. It feels cheap. And the 
social aspect isn’t there yet. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I stuck with it all year, but have used it less than ever in recent months. In the first half of 2023, Artifact’s suggestions were improving steadily for me, but in recent months the quality of the suggestions dropped off a cliff for me. Lots of clickbait.</p>

<p>They added the social component, with the ability to post articles and add comments, but those features didn’t make the overall product any better. And while the core reading experience improved, it never improved to the point where it was as good as reading in Safari. Their refusal to focus on providing first and foremost a premium <em>reading</em> experience is exemplified by their own blog post announcing their shutdown. It looks <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/01/shutting-down-artifact-medium-box-mac.png">like this on MacOS</a>, and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/misc/2024/01/shutting-down-artifact-medium-box-iphone.png">this on iOS</a>.

<h1><a href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/al_gore_mac_nerd_internet_pioneer" title="Permanent link to ‘Al Gore, Mac Nerd and Internet Pioneer’">Al Gore, Mac Nerd and Internet Pioneer</a></h1>
<h6 class="dateline">Friday, 12 January 2024</h6>

<p><a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2003/03/19Former-Vice-President-Al-Gore-Joins-Apples-Board-of-Directors/">Apple press release, on 19 March 2003</a> (about seven months after I started writing Daring Fireball<sup id="fnr1-2024-01-12"><a href="#fn1-2024-01-12">1</a></sup>):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced that Albert Gore Jr., the former Vice 
President of the United States, has joined the Company’s Board of 
Directors. Mr. Gore was elected at Apple’s board meeting today. </p>

<p>“Al brings an incredible wealth of knowledge and wisdom to Apple 
from having helped run the largest organization in the world — the United States government — as a Congressman, Senator and our 
45th Vice President. Al is also an avid Mac user and does his own 
video editing in Final Cut Pro,” said Steve Jobs, Apple’s CEO. “Al 
is going to be a terrific Director and we’re excited and honored 
that he has chosen Apple as his first private sector board to 
serve on.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I love that the second sentence from Jobs was about how Gore is a Mac enthusiast who uses Final Cut Pro. Compare and contrast with today’s <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/01/wanda-austin-to-join-apples-board-of-directors/">utterly milquetoast statements from Tim Cook and chairman Arthur Levinson</a> about new board member Wanda Austin:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Wanda has spent decades advancing technology on behalf of 
humanity, and we’re thrilled to welcome her to Apple’s board of 
directors,” said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. “She’s an extraordinary 
leader, and her invaluable experience and expertise will support 
our mission of leaving the world better than we found it.” </p>

<p>“Wanda has long been a leader in unleashing the potential of 
cutting-edge technology,” said Arthur Levinson, the chair of 
Apple’s board of directors. “She brings incredible insights and 
experience to our board, and she will play an important role in 
helping Apple continue enriching users’ lives around the world.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2003 there was one person in the world who could be described as a former vice president of the United States and avid Mac user. (That’s still true today, and that person remains Al Gore.) Cook’s and Levinson’s descriptions of Austin could apply to just about any technology company executive in the world.</p>

<p>Gore’s statement from 2003:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Steve and his team have done an incredible job in making Apple 
once again the very best in the world,” said former Vice President 
Al Gore. “I have been particularly impressed with the new Mac OS X 
operating system and the company’s commitment to the open source 
movement. And I am especially looking forward to working with and 
learning from the great board members who have guided this 
legendary company’s inspiring resurgence.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>In 2003, Mac OS X was the most important product for the future of the company, and the open source movement was one of the major stories of the moment.</p>

<p>Austin’s statement today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Like Apple, I’ve always believed in the power of innovation to 
improve lives, support human potential, and shape a better 
future,” said Dr. Austin. “I’m honored to join Apple’s board of 
directors, and I look forward to being part of a company that’s 
always creating new ways to empower people all over the world.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>She could have said the exact same thing about joining the board of <em>any</em> tech company in the world today. If she serves for 20 years, like Gore did (which is unlikely, given that she’s already 70 and Gore is stepping down because of a policy “directors generally may not stand for reelection after reaching age 75”<sup id="fnr2-2024-01-12"><a href="#fn2-2024-01-12">2</a></sup>), no one in the year 2044 is going to look back on her statement above and think, <em>Yeah, that captures what was then the current moment for Apple.</em> Austin may well be a perfect candidate to serve on Apple’s board, but there’s nothing in today’s press release that indicates why.</p>

<p>Gore was widely mocked in the run-up to the 2000 election for supposedly claiming to have “invented the internet”. But he never claimed any such thing. <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/internet-of-lies/">From Snopes</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The claim that Gore was actually trying to take credit for the 
“invention” of the Internet was plainly just derisive political 
posturing that arose out of a close presidential campaign. If, for 
example, Dwight Eisenhower had said in the mid-1960s that he, 
while president, “took the initiative in creating the Interstate 
Highway System,” he would not have been the subject of dozens and 
dozens of editorials lampooning him for claiming he “invented” the 
concept of highways or implying that he personally went out and 
dug ditches across the country to help build the roadway. Everyone 
would have understood that Eisenhower meant he was a driving force 
behind the legislation that created the highway system, and this 
was the very same concept Al Gore was expressing about himself 
with interview remarks about the Internet. [...] </p>

<p>A <a href="https://amsterdam.nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-l-0009/msg00311.html">spirited defense of Gore’s statement</a> penned by Internet 
pioneers Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf (the latter often referred to 
as the “father of the Internet”) in 2000 noted that “Al Gore was 
the first political leader to recognize the importance of the 
Internet and to promote and support its development” and that “No 
other elected official, to our knowledge, has made a greater 
contribution [to the Internet] over a longer period of time.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not a bad endorsement.&nbsp;<a class="permalink" title="Permanent link to ‘Al Gore, Mac Nerd and Internet Pioneer’" href="https://daringfireball.net/2024/01/al_gore_mac_nerd_internet_pioneer">&#9733;</a></p>

<p>Apple Newsroom:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple today announced Dr. Wanda Austin, former president and CEO 
of The Aerospace Corporation, has been nominated for election to 
Apple’s board of directors. Dr. Austin brings decades of science 
and technology experience to her role, and she has a significant 
track record of advancing innovation and shaping corporate 
strategy. </p>

<p>As president and CEO of The Aerospace Corporation, Dr. Austin led 
an organization dedicated to supporting the U.S. space program and 
expanding opportunities for future exploration. She was the first 
woman and the first African American to hold the position. [...] </p>

<p>The board has a longstanding policy that directors generally may 
not stand for reelection after reaching age 75. As a result, Al 
Gore, who has served since 2003, and James Bell, who joined in 
2015, will both retire from Apple’s board this year. </p>

<p>“We’re deeply grateful to Al and James for their many years of 
service to Apple — their insights, energy, and values have made 
us a stronger company in so many ways,” said Cook. “For more than 
20 years, Al has contributed an incredible amount to our work — from his unconditional support for protecting our users’ privacy, 
to his incomparable knowledge of environment and climate issues.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I strongly suspect that even if Gore had never joined the board, Apple would be a staunchly environmentally-minded company today, but surely Gore pushed them hard in that direction. And I think he was instrumental in Apple’s hiring of Lisa Jackson.</p>

<p>My recent spate of Tetris-related links got me thinking again about this post from 2018:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>So as far as I can tell, not only is there no official Tetris for 
Mac, there are no Tetris-like games either. Back in the 90s, there 
were several really good Tetris games for the Mac. Anyone remember 
<a href="https://harddrop.com/wiki/Wesleyan_Tetris">Wesleyan Tetris</a>? It was a goofy version in which the 
developer, Randall Cook, would rudely critique your gameplay. </p>

<p>If The Tetris Company wants to protect the name “Tetris”, fine, 
but I think it sucks that there’s no good way to play the game on 
a Mac today. Every computer should have a good version of Tetris. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Not much has changed from 2018. There is an officially licensed game in the Mac App Store now: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tetris-beat/id1536485727">Tetris Beat</a>. It’s part of Apple Arcade, so most of you can probably download it and play it. It’s not just plain Tetris — and whatever it is that it wants to be, it sucks. It doesn’t even let you customize the controls. It occupies 2.3 GB on disk after installation. For Tetris! Jiminy. <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/11/wirth-plea-for-lean-software">Niklaus Wirth would be rolling over</a> in his (<a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/11/niklaus-wirth-rip">fresh</a>) grave if you told him a Tetris game took 2.3 GB on disk and made the fans get loud on an Apple silicon MacBook Pro when you play it.</p>

<p>The best options for just playing Tetris on a Mac are web games: <a href="https://tetr.io/">Tetr.io</a> and <a href="https://jstris.jezevec10.com/">Jstris</a>. (I presume both websites are hosted in countries outside the reach of litigious The Tetris Company.) Tetr.io offers “desktop” versions, but their Mac app is an Intel-only Electron app that instantly made the fans on my MacBook Pro veritably roar. It’s far better playing online in Safari, but Tetr.io is geared toward Tetris fanatics, not casual play. Jstris is simpler, but fundamentally exists as a platform for competitive online play. (Go to Play → Practice to just play single player.)</p>

<p>What a sad state of affairs. A hearty <em>fuck you</em> to The Tetris Company for ruthlessly shutting down hobbyist clones while refusing to license a decent official just-plain-Tetris Mac app.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Hard to believe I didn’t come across this on my own, but it turns out The Tetris Company has <a href="https://tetris.com/play-tetris">a decent simple Tetris game on their own website</a>.</p>

<p>From an essay Niklaus Wirth published in IEEE’s “Computer” magazine in 1995 (<a href="https://github.com/sysprv/demo-corporate-documentation-public/blob/master/Niklaus%20Wirth%20-%20A%20Plea%20for%20Lean%20Software.pdf">original PDF</a>), some lessons learned in the development of Wirth’s Oberon system:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li><p>The belief that complex systems require armies of designers and 
programmers is wrong. A system that is not understood in its 
entirety, or at least to significant degree of detail by a 
single individual, should probably not be built. </p></li>
<li><p>Communication problems grow as the size of the design team 
grows. Whether they are obvious or not, when communication 
problems predominate, the team and the project are both in deep 
trouble. </p></li>
<li><p>Reducing complexity and size must be the goal in every step — in system specification, design, and in detailed programming. A 
programmer’s competence should be judged by the ability to find 
simple solutions, certainly not by productivity measured in 
“number of lines ejected per day.” Prolific programmers 
contribute to certain disaster. </p></li>
<li><p>Programs should be written and polished until they acquire 
publication quality. It is infinitely more demanding to design a 
publishable program than one that “runs.” Programs should be 
written for human readers as well as for computers. If this 
notion contradicts certain vested interests in the commercial 
world, it should at least find no resistance in academia. </p></li>

<p>David A. Graham, writing at The Atlantic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a hearing before the D.C. Circuit Court, the former president’s 
lawyers argued that he should be immune from criminal prosecution 
for his role in the attempt to steal the 2020 presidential 
election. This argument has an obvious flaw: It implies that the 
president is above the law. Such a blunt rejection of the 
Constitution and the basic concept of American democracy is too 
much even for Trump to assert — publicly, at least — so his 
lawyers have proposed a theory. They say that he can’t be 
criminally prosecuted unless he is first impeached and convicted 
by Congress. </p>

<p>This argument is no less dangerous, as a hypothetical asked in 
court demonstrated in chilling terms. Judge Florence Pan asked 
Trump’s attorney, D. John Sauer, if “a president who ordered SEAL 
Team 6 to assassinate a political rival” could be criminally 
prosecuted. Sauer tried to hem and haw his way through an answer 
but ultimately stated that such a president couldn’t be prosecuted 
unless he was first impeached, convicted, and removed by Congress. </p>

<p>“But if he weren’t, there would be no criminal prosecution, no 
criminal liability for that?” Pan pressed. Sauer had no choice but 
to agree, because acknowledging any exceptions would have blown a 
hole in his argument. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The most forgiving take on this argument is that Trump’s legal team doesn’t mean it, and they’re merely stalling for time — throwing as much shit as possible up against the appeals court walls, hoping to delay his umpteen trials until after his possible reelection in a year. But Trump himself <a href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4400173-trump-immunity-golden-years-retirement/">clearly means it</a>. (<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cover-story/cover-story-2024-01-15">Barry Blitt’s cover illustration</a> for The New Yorker this week is sublime.)</p>

<p>The best refutation of Trump’s argument that presidents are above the law, and accountable only to Congressional impeachment, <a href="https://www.threads.net/@repraskin/post/C175OMORWpa">comes from Representative Jamie Raskin</a>, who points to the glaring game theory hole in this absurd argument: if it were true, the president could order the assassination of any congressperson who threatened to impeach or convict him. As Raskin concluded, “This is the GOP 2024.”</p>

<p>Liam Proven, in a nice obituary in The Register:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Swiss computer scientist Professor Niklaus Wirth died on New 
Year’s Day, roughly six weeks before what would have been his 90th 
birthday. </p>

<p><a href="https://people.inf.ethz.ch/wirth/">Wirth</a> is justly celebrated as the creator of the Pascal 
programming language, but that was only one step in a series of 
important languages and research projects. Both <a href="https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/tools/sbdb_lookup.html#/?sstr=21655">asteroid 
21655</a> and a <a href="https://www.techslang.com/definition/what-is-wirths-law/">law of computer design</a> are named after 
him. He won computer-science boffinry’s highest possible gong, the 
Turing Award, <a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/wirth_1025774.cfm">in 1984</a>, and that page has some short 
English-language clips from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SUgrS_KbSI8">2018 interview</a>. [...]</p>

<p>As described in C H Lindsey’s <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/234286.1057810">History of ALGOL-68</a> [PDF], 
when the ALGOL-W proposal was rejected, Wirth resigned from the 
committee, contributing a strong <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/algol/algol_bulletin/A29/P32.HTM">“Closing Word”</a> to the 
November 1968 <a href="https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/algol/algol_bulletin/">Algol Bulletin 29</a>, containing gems such as: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I pulled out my copy of the draft report on ALGOL-68 and showed it 
to her. She fainted. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead, Wirth took his proposal, changed it to be somewhat 
less compatible with ALGOL, and released it in 1970 under the 
name Pascal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wirth%27s_law">Wirth’s Law</a> encapsulates Wirth’s philosophy: “The hope is that the progress in hardware will cure all software ills. However, a critical observer may observe that software manages to outgrow hardware in size and sluggishness.” Or, as he rephrased it in his <a href="http://www.projectoberon.net/wirth/ProjectOberon/PO.System.pdf">paper describing Project Oberon</a>: “In spite of great leaps forward, hardware is becoming faster more slowly than software is becoming slower.” In many ways, this remains <em>the</em> fundamental problem of our entire industry. It’s a truism, and can only be mitigated. </p>

<p>He endorsed simplicity and clarity, and his languages and system designs exemplified those ideals. Studying computer science in the early to mid-1990s, I was among the last to learn Pascal as a teaching language. After outgrowing BASIC, I had actually started learning Pascal my senior year in high school, in a class with just two other students — thanks, Mrs. Spatz — and it was that class that made me want to study computer science in college.</p>

<p>And Pascal was to the original Macintosh what Objective-C was to Mac OS X — the language Apple established as the default for writing application software. Most of the apps that established the Macintosh as the platform for people with good taste in the 1980s and early 1990s were written in Pascal. <a href="http://www.think-pascal.org/">THINK Pascal</a> was an IDE years — maybe over a decade — ahead of its time.

<p>Jason Koebler, writing for 404 Media:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A 13-year-old competitive Tetris player has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9oVQ43j22g&amp;ref=404media.co">become the first 
known human</a> to beat the game on the original NES by 
forcing it into a kill screen. In doing so, the player, Blue 
Scuti, broke world records for overall score, level achieved, and 
total numbers of lines in the 34-year-old game. Previously, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_KY_EwZEVA&amp;ref=404media.co">only 
an AI had broken Tetris</a>. </p>

<p>The feat took Blue Scuti about 38 minutes, as shown in a video he 
posted to his YouTube. As he nears the feat, Blue Scuti says “Oh I 
missed it,” after misplacing a block. He recovers, then says “Oh 
my God,” as it seems like he’ll be able to do it. “Please crash,” 
he says as the blocks careen down the screen impossibly fast. He 
gets another line and the game freezes: “Oh my God! Yes! I’m going 
to pass out,” he says. “I can’t feel my hands.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>From <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/03/arts/tetris-beat-blue-scuti.html">Sopan Deb’s story about Gibson for The New York Times</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ms. Cox bought her son a version of a Nintendo console called a 
RetroN, which used the same hardware as the original Nintendo 
console, from a pawnshop, as well as an old cathode-ray tube 
television to help him get started. In a given week, Willis said, 
he plays about 20 hours of Tetris. </p>

<p>“I’m actually OK with it,” Ms. Cox, a high school math teacher, 
said. “He does other things outside of playing Tetris, so it 
really wasn’t that terribly difficult to say OK. It was harder to 
find an old CRT TV than it was to say, ‘Yeah, we can do this for a 
little bit.’” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Koebler’s story ends with a sad note: “Blue Scuti dedicated the game to his dad, Adam Gibson, who died in December.” My mom’s mother died when my mom was just 16, so I’m familiar, second-hand, with how devastating such a loss is. Young Gibson seems utterly delightful — a gracious champion — so we’d all be rooting for him anyway, but this adds a note of poignancy.</p>

<p><strong>Recommended viewing:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuJ5UuknsHU">This 17-minute video from aGameScout</a> is a wonderful, fun explanation of Gibson’s feat — it explains why NES Tetris was, for decades, thought to end at level 29; the new advanced controller techniques that allow elite players to blow past level 29; and suggests future accomplishments that remain unachieved.</p>

<p>Alex Heath, reporting for The Verge:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Humane laid off 4 percent of employees this week in a move that 
was described as a cost cutting measure to those who were 
impacted, according to sources familiar with the matter. Employees 
were recently told by leadership that budgets would be lowered 
this year, said one of the people, who requested anonymity to 
speak without the company’s permission. </p>

<p>The cuts, which numbered 10 people, come ahead of the 
five-year-old startup shipping its first device: a $699, 
screenless, AI-powered pin that is pitched as a smartphone 
replacement. </p>

<p>In a text message, Bongiorno told me that the cuts were “not 
communicated as a layoff” to those who were impacted, despite 
sources telling me that they were — both verbally and in writing. 
“It goes without saying that, like every company, we have a 
responsibility to remain prudent and proactive, ensuring we have 
the right roles, right people, and the right structure at every 
juncture,” she said. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Layoffs are never good — and layoffs before shipping the company’s first product are a particularly bad look — but 10/250 employees really does sound more like belt-tightening. But I do not think their AI Pin preorder numbers have set the world afire, nor do I think the company’s investors are interested in funding them further. (Sam Altman, <a href="https://www.lowpass.cc/p/humane-ai-pin-cellular-mvno-sam-altman">Humane’s largest shareholder</a>, is <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2023/12/26/tang-tan-lovefrom">reportedly working with Jony Ive and LoveFrom</a> on “AI hardware”. To me, that’s far more of a warning sign about Humane than their laying off 10 employees.)</p>

<p>Not only was the phone still in working order — it was seemingly unscathed. It has a case and a screen protector, but landing on grass was surely a huge factor. Just amazing.</p>

<p>When I first saw this story, I was skeptical, wondering how Bates got past the lock screen. But the phone had no passcode, <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanSafyre/status/1744203705178845510">as Bates described in a follow-up video</a>. I find that almost as crazy as the phone surviving a 16,000-foot drop, but I’d probably be shocked to know how many people rock the no-passcode lifestyle. I just don’t get it, given how Face ID makes it feel like you don’t have a passcode.</p>

<dd>
<p>PBS News Hour:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Federal investigators say a door panel slid up before flying off 
an Alaska Airlines jetliner last week, and they are looking at 
whether four bolts that were supposed to help hold the panel in 
place might have been missing when the plane took off. The 
comments Monday from the National Transportation Safety Board came 
shortly after Alaska and United Airlines reported separately that 
they found loose parts in the panels — or door plugs — of some 
other Boeing 737 Max 9 jets. </p>

<p>“Since we began preliminary inspections on Saturday, we have found 
instances that appear to relate to installation issues in the door 
plug — for example, bolts that needed additional tightening,” 
Chicago-based United said. </p>

<p>Alaska said that as it began examining its Max 9s, “Initial 
reports from our technicians indicate some loose hardware was 
visible on some aircraft.” </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This tidbit seems nutty to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The jet involved in Friday’s blowout is brand-new, having been put 
in service in November. After a cabin-pressurization system 
warning light came on during three flights, the airline stopped 
flying it over the Pacific to Hawaii. Some aviation experts 
questioned why Alaska continued using the plane on overland routes 
until it figured out what was causing the pressurization warnings. </p>

<p>Homendy said Monday, however, that NTSB has seen no evidence to 
link the warnings with the blowout of the door plug. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>There may be no evidence yet, but what are the odds that a door plug that blew off a brand-new jet mid-flight — in a fleet of planes they’ve now discovered have loose bolts holding those doors in place — wasn’t to blame for the cabin-pressurization warnings? And, even if it’s true that the pressurization warnings were unrelated to last week’s incident, that’s even <em>worse</em> for Boeing — that would mean they have a problem with these door plugs <em>and</em> an as-yet undetermined other problem. I’m surprised that Boeing’s stock is only down ~8 percent.</p>

<p><a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/we-ve-resubmitted-the-hey-calendar-app-to-apple-57240fbb">David Heinemeier Hansson</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Apple waited until end of business on Friday to send us the formal 
rejection of the HEY Calendar app. It seems they love to play 
these little games to try to drown any controversy with the cover 
of a weekend. But we don’t roll over that easy, so the team worked 
through the weekend to prepare a new build to appease the App 
Store’s bullying bureaucrats, and I think you’re going to like 
what we came up with. </p>

<p>See, Apple’s stated reason for rejecting the HEY Calendar app is 
once again that “it doesn’t do anything when you download it”. In 
other words, it features a login screen, and requires you to have 
an existing account with <a href="https://www.hey.com/">our HEY email service</a> in order 
to use it. It’s the textbook definition of a free companion app, 
which Apple specifically <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#business">exempts from having to use in-app 
payments</a>. They even cite Email Services(!!) as an example 
in 3.1.3(f): </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em><strong>3.1.3(f) Free Stand-alone Apps:</strong> Free apps acting as a 
stand-alone companion to a paid web based tool (eg. VOIP, Cloud 
Storage, Email Services, Web Hosting) do not need to use 
in-app purchase, provided there is no purchasing inside the app, 
or calls to action for purchase outside of the app.</em> </p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems bonkers to me that after <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/16/hey-iap-app-store-dispute">all the bad publicity that befell Apple in June 2020</a> over Apple’s rejection of the Hey email app, they’d veto a Hey companion app — which requires the exact same type of account as Hey email — for the exact same reasons. They should have just let it through, for the risk of bad publicity alone.</p>

<p>Here’s just a taste from my own coverage of the Hey email app rejection back in June 2020:</p>

</ul>

<p>Apple doesn’t want people writing articles like those (or this very one) this week. They want people writing articles about Vision Pro.</p>

<p>More crucially, regulators and legislators around the world are looking to wield antitrust powers against Apple, and all of them are primarily looking at the App Store. The stakes for Apple are much higher today than they were in 2020. The last thing Apple wants is a news narrative along the lines of “<em>More Bullshit From Apple Trying to Squeeze Developers Into Giving Them a Cut of Revenue When the Developers Simply Want to Sell Subscriptions Directly to Customers Over the Web</em>”. But by rejecting Hey Calendar, they seem to be <em>inviting</em> such a narrative.</p>

<p>I just don’t get it. Apple has nothing to gain by this — *nothing, not a cent — but a lot to lose.</p>

<p>My thanks to Flexibits for sponsoring the previous two weeks at Daring Fireball. Fantastical isn’t just the best calendaring app for iOS and Mac; Cardhop isn’t just the best contacts app for iOS and Mac — these are two of the best apps in the world today, period.</p>

<p>And, lo, Fantastical is no longer just for Mac, iPhone, and iPad. From Apple’s Newsroom announcement about Vision Pro pre-orders and availability today:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An infinite canvas for productivity: With key productivity and 
collaboration apps like Fantastical, Freeform, JigSpace, apps from 
Microsoft 365, and Slack, Apple Vision Pro is an ideal 
productivity tool for everyday tasks. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I believe this means that Fantastical is the first third-party VisionOS app Apple has ever mentioned. Can’t wait to see it.</p>

<p>2023 was a huge year for Flexibits, and they have <a href="https://flexibits.com/blog/2023/12/the-flexibits-2023-year-in-review/">a terrific year-in-review blog post</a> that runs down all the details. But the highlights are obvious: excellent support for widgets (on all platforms, including interactive widgets on the latest OSes) and Live Activities on iOS. They also added several improvements to their Openings feature that lets people find meeting times that work for everyone.</p>

<p>Flexibits has a killer offer for DF readers: <a href="https://flexibits.com/df2024">20 percent off for up to two full years</a>, both for new <em>and</em> current Flexibits subscribers. I just used the code to renew my own annual subscription. Even if your subscription isn’t due for renewal yet, you can apply the code now. But act fast — the deal is only good through the end of day Tuesday.</p>

</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>During the Vision Pro segment of The Talk Show Live From WWDC 2023, I started describing Vision Pro as “a product coming next year, or early next year, I forget which...”, and Greg Joswiak and Mike Rockwell, in unison, <a href="https://youtu.be/DgLrBSQ6x7E?si=7Imb4wF1Uk5FgdS9&amp;t=2584">interrupted me to say “<em>Early</em> next year.”</a> I then asked for further clarification on the definition of “early”, and laughter ensued — but Apple wasn’t kidding. This is pretty much as early as early could be in 2024.</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
<li>ZEISS Optical Inserts — Readers will be available for $99 
(U.S.), and ZEISS Optical Inserts — Prescription will be 
available for $149 (U.S.).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s new territory for a device to cost more if you require corrective lenses, but it’s the nature of Vision Pro that it will not fit over glasses, so there’s no way around this. People accustomed to $10 readers from the drug store may be surprised at these prices, but these $100–150 seems fair for high-quality lenses. I suspect, though, that there will spring a cottage industry for lower-priced third-party lens inserts.</p>

<p>I still have questions about how buyers will provide their prescriptions to Apple. In most countries, people can just buy corrective glasses and contacts lenses without a prescription, but the U.S. — ostensibly the land of freedom — requires a doctor’s prescription. (Ophthalmologists have a strong <a href="https://www.aao.org/advocacy/ophthpac/overview">lobbying group</a>.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Also unclear at the moment: How many different Light Seals are available? What app will online buyers use to scan their faces for sizing? How much will extra Light Seals (for additional users) cost?</p>

<p>Remarkable speech by President Biden, on the eve of the third anniversary of Trump’s Capitol insurrection:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let’s be clear about the 2020 election. Trump exhausted every 
legal avenue available to him to overturn the election. Every one, 
but the legal path just took Trump back to the truth, that I’d won 
the election and he was a loser. </p>

<p>Well, so knowing how his mind works now, he had one, he had one 
act left. One desperate act available to him, the violence of 
January the sixth. </p>

<p>Since that day, more than 1,200 people have been charged with 
assault in the Capitol. Nearly 900 of them have been convicted or 
pled guilty. Collectively to date, they have been sentenced to 
more than 840 years in prison. </p>

<p>What’s Trump done? Instead of calling them criminals, he’s called 
these insurrectionists patriots. They’re patriots. And he promised 
to pardon them if he returns to office. Trump said that there was 
a lot of love on January the sixth. </p>

<p>The rest of the nation, including law enforcement, saw a lot of 
hate and violence. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-speech-valley-forge-trump-campaign-bda2293cac2b30e49157c2e6fb256d64">The AP has a transcript</a>, but I suggest watching it. Biden gets it. Democracy <em>is</em> our sacred cause. It’s that simple. Trump lost, and he tried his ham-fisted best to stay in office anyway. Quoting Biden: “We all know who Donald Trump is. The question we have to answer is: Who are we?”</p>

<p>Nancy Pelosi, writing in The Atlantic:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The threat to our democracy is real, present, and urgent. The 
parable of January 6 reminds us that our precious democratic 
institutions are only as strong as the courage and commitment of 
those entrusted with their care. We all share a responsibility to 
preserve American democracy, which Lincoln called “the last best 
hope of earth.” </p>

<p>Yours truly, back when the iPhone 3GS was new:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I think the question boils down to whether Apple is making a 
mistake by not making an iPhone with a hardware keyboard. I’m 
convinced the answer is no — that (a) there will never be an 
iPhone with a built-in hardware keyboard; and (b) Apple will not 
suffer for it. [...]</p>

<p>Are software touchscreen keyboards good for everyone? Certainly 
not. But this is another aspect of the Apple Way. Apple tries to 
make things that many people love, not things that all people 
like. The key is that they’re not afraid of the staunch criticism, 
and often outright derision, that comes with breaking conventions. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Holds up. In 2023 it seems wild that Apple’s all-in bet on touchscreen keyboards for iPhones was controversial at all, let alone the subject of vociferous debate for years.</p>

<p>If the <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2024/01/04/clicks">aforelinked</a> new Clicks keyboard case for iPhones rings a bell, here’s Jon Fingas reporting for Engadget 10 years ago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The market for keyboard-equipped phones may be on the wane, but 
don’t tell that to Ryan Seacrest — the American Idol host is 
convinced that messaging mavens need real buttons. To that end, 
he’s jumping into hardware and launching the Typo Keyboard for the 
iPhone 5 and 5S. The Bluetooth case turns an Apple handset into a 
makeshift BlackBerry Q10, complete with backlit, sculpted keys 
that cover up the iPhone’s home button (there’s a small substitute 
key); we hope you don’t need multitasking, folks. The Typo 
Keyboard will make its formal debut at CES in early January, and 
it should ship that month for $99. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Typo keyboard was doomed in more ways than one: it used unreliable battery-draining Bluetooth, not a wired connection; iOS didn’t have good hardware keyboard support at the time; and, as Fingas alludes in his description above, the Typo keyboard’s design covered the iPhone’s home button. That was pretty much a dealbreaker for the iPhone 5S, which introduced Touch ID.</p>

<p>Even worse, the shell of the company that was once the mighty BlackBerry <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/1/8696991/blackberry-typo-keyboard-lawsuit-settlement">sued Typo for patent infringement</a>, won, and eventually <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/mobile/seacrest-out-blackberry-kills-his-typo-iphone-keyboard-n367736">drove Typo out of business</a>. (Kudos to NBC News for that “Seacrest Out” headline.)</p>

<p>I never even owned a smartphone with a hardware keyboard, but as soon as I saw this I wanted one: Clicks is a new $139 hardware keyboard case for the iPhone 14 Pro, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro Max (that one will cost $159 — Max phones have max prices). One of the creators of the project is Michael “MrMobile” Fisher, who, of course, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2n2ftM-MwI">created a YouTube video for the project</a>. (One of his co-creators is <a href="https://crackberry.com/clicks-iphone-brings-real-keyboard-back-smartphones">CrackBerry Kevin</a> — so there are some serious “hardware phone keyboard aficionado” bona fides on the team.)</p>

<p>I don’t know how much I’ll wind up using it but it looks fun, useful, and clever — and I’m just a sucker for upstart indie hardware projects. Clicks is even a great name. There’s no Bluetooth involved — it connects via Lightning or USB-C, just like any hardware keyboard can via a cable. If you’ve never connected a hardware keyboard to an iPhone before, you might be surprised how many keyboard shortcuts there are (Command-Space for Spotlight, Space and Shift-Space for paging down and up in Safari, Command-H to go to the Home screen, and more.)</p>

<p>You’ll never guess which color I pre-ordered.</p>
